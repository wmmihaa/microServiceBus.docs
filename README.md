* Desired state
    * Desired state is a useful feature which has been available for AWS from the early beginning (_Shadows_). This has now also been implemented in Azure IoT, and is referred to as _Device-Twin._
    * we’ve added several _Services_ to the Flow toolbox to support _Desired State_ features, both to set state, and to read state.

    * On the details page for each node, there is now a _Tags_ field. This is a field where you can provide a comma-separated list of tags. These _Tags_ can later be used in the Node setting of Inbound Services of _Flows_. This way you can configure many nodes through one single _Service_. To use _Tags_ in Services, simply use #[TAG], Eg. #building3.
*  ServiceNow integration
    * microServiceBus.com is now fully integrated with [ServiceNow](https://www.servicenow.com/), and can escalate issues and abnormalities to ServiceNow. This is an enterprise feature, and is not available for the trial edition.
*  Whitelist
    * By uploading a whitelist (Node page) containing MAC addresses and node settings, nodes can sign in using simply a “-w” flag. Eg. node start -w
    * If the “-w” flag is used, the node will provide its MAC address when making its initial call to microServiceBus.com. If the MAC address is registered, the node will be provided all other settings and continue.
*  Remote debugging
    * This feature enables you to set breakpoints and remotely control the scripts and services running on the node. Check out [Debug your nodes](https://microservicebus.com/Posts/View/1021) for more information
*  Remote Restart and Reboot
    * From the Node page your are now given a set of _Actions_ to control your node. The _Reboot_ option will re-start your node, but requires the process to run with enough privileges. The _Restart_ option restarts the Core process and will download any updated packages.
