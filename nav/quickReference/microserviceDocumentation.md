# Microservices in mSB.com in depth

This page is dedicated to those with a bit of prior knowledge regarding how flows and services in *microServiceBus.com* works. If you are not familiar with these concepts yet, please visit the [Getting started](/gettingstarted/README.md) first.

When you as a developer is writing a service to use in a flow, you are extending the *microservice* object *microServiceBus.com* is exposing. This object has a number of functions and properties that could help you develop your code. First we will go through what is required in your own service, then what is available to you and lastly som best practices.

## Required functions

* **Start()**

  This function will be called when your node starts and your service has been downloaded.
  
  `@parameters` : none

  `@returns` : <_void_>

  `@example`

  ```javascript
    Start : function(){
        let timerEvent = setInterval(function(){
            //start your reoccuring logic
        }, 10000)
    }
  ```
> **Tip!**
> Here it is great to add all your NPM packages.
